#A “living wage” is an estimate of the minimum amount of money a family living in a specific area needs to earn to meet its basic needs
and be self-sufficient.In some areas, people working at jobs that pay the “minimum wage,” do not earn a living wage for their family.
Thus, there is a “gap” between the minimum wage salary and the living wage. This is a program named LivingWage that allows the user to examine living and minimum wage data for various states as well as detect “gap states,” states where people
earning the minimum wage are not able to earn a living wage. The provided living wage amounts for each state are based on a family of 
three, with two working adults and one child. If the total income for two adults, who each work 40 hours per week for 52 weeks 
(this assumes no sick days or vacation days) for a total of 2080 working hours and are paid the minimum wage, is less than the living wage
for the state, the state is considered to be a gap state.
